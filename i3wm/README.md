Is a very good pratice share materials to help others users. So, I like so much that!!

That's so simple.

## Install

Read the [dependency section](#dependency) before.

So, to install do you just need download, extract and rename folder. Look:

* GNU/Linux :)
```
$ wget https://github.com/gjuniioor/i3wm-files/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ mv i3wm-files-master ~/.i3
```

## Dependency

You just need install the complete group of i3wm, like i3lock, i3bar, i3status, dmenu...

* Arch Linux: `# pacman -S i3 dmenu`
